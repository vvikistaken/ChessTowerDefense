To finish/fix:
-E 0:00:10:0500   can_process: Condition "!is_inside_tree()" is true. Returning: false
  <C++ Source>   scene/main/node.cpp:762 @ can_process()
	-don't know why this pops up
		-it only happens when InputEventScreenTouch
	-happens when taking pieces
	-it started to happen when i changed some stuff in OnPieceClicked
-signal shenanigans
	-probably i need to figure out event bus
	-also thats the reason why nothing works rn

To add:
-tower defense element 
	-only cash is a td element rn(it doesn't even have function yet)
	-menu for pieces(right click and options show up)
-title screen
	-different modes
	-settings menu

To change:
-make (???, i just didnt finish writing here)
-maybe add background showing which side turn it is
-play around with default cursor shape in chess piece
